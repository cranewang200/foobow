# Foobow Memory

This file is the project-local memory. Keep it current whenever product direction, implementation scope, verification, or repo state changes.

## 2026-06-06

- Initialized the local repo in `D:\code\projects\mobileapp\gooddeed` and connected `origin` to `https://github.com/cranewang200/foobow.git`.
- Added the first product deliverable: README, product spec, user stories, reference-product notes, and a static clickable prototype.
- Preserved the existing empty `foobow.com.txt`.
- Created local commit `d2e87b4` with message `Initial Foobow product spec and prototype`.
- Push to GitHub failed with HTTP 403 because the active GitHub credential was `regwang3713`, which does not have permission to push to `cranewang200/foobow.git`.
- Added the second foundation slice: ODD spec, database structure, API interface, project plan, task board, CI workflow, and dependency-free unit/smoke/PA test scripts.
- Added prototype hardening: structured sample data module, local persistence, export/delete controls, blessing report actions, focus states, reduced-motion handling, and object-level acceptance criteria.
- Verified prototype with real Playwright browser runner loaded from `file:///D:/code/projects/mobileapp/gooddeed/prototype/index.html`; mood, deed, map, blessing, report, profile, donation, theme, language, and localStorage persistence flows passed.

## Working Principles

- Use ODD to keep development tied to product objects and user-visible value.
- Prefer reusable patterns from proven products before inventing custom behavior.
- Keep docs updated with each meaningful project change.
- Maintain automated checks for docs, prototype smoke behavior, and PA readiness.
- Treat virtual karma as symbolic comfort; keep verified donations transparent and separate.

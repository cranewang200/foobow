# Foobow Memory

This file is the project-local memory. Keep it current whenever product direction, implementation scope, verification, or repo state changes.

## 2026-06-06

- Initialized the local repo in `D:\code\projects\mobileapp\gooddeed` and connected `origin` to `https://github.com/cranewang200/foobow.git`.
- Added the first product deliverable: README, product spec, user stories, reference-product notes, and a static clickable prototype.
- Preserved the existing empty `foobow.com.txt`.
- Created local commit `d2e87b4` with message `Initial Foobow product spec and prototype`.
- Push to GitHub failed with HTTP 403 because the active GitHub credential was `regwang3713`, which does not have permission to push to `cranewang200/foobow.git`.
- Added the second foundation slice: ODD spec, database structure, API interface, project plan, task board, CI workflow, and dependency-free unit/smoke/PA test scripts.
- Added prototype hardening: structured sample data module, local persistence, export/delete controls, blessing report actions, focus states, reduced-motion handling, and object-level acceptance criteria.
- Verified prototype with real Playwright browser runner loaded from `file:///D:/code/projects/mobileapp/gooddeed/prototype/index.html`; mood, deed, map, blessing, report, profile, donation, theme, language, and localStorage persistence flows passed.
- Hardened database/API planning with primary key guidance, relationships, indexes, privacy retention, migration strategy, API base path, cursor pagination, error shape, rate limits, donation idempotency, and payment webhook flow.
- Added `@playwright/test`, browser PA tests for mobile/desktop core prototype flows, and a CI stage that installs Chromium and runs `npm run test:browser`.
- Added category filters for map spots and deed catalog, keyboard-accessible deed selection, and automated Playwright checks for filters, keyboard traversal, keyboard activation, and WCAG 4.5:1 core token contrast.
- Accepted ADR 001: use Expo + React Native + TypeScript for the MVP mobile app scaffold under `apps/mobile`.
- Scaffolded Expo SDK 56 / React Native 0.85 / TypeScript app in `apps/mobile`, removed generated nested `.git`, ported Foobow core flows into `App.tsx`, added typed sample data, and added `npm run test:mobile` typecheck.
- Local scaffold warning: Expo SDK 56 dependencies expect Node `^20.19.4 || ^22.13.0 || ^24.3.0 || >=25.0.0`; current local Node is `20.17.0`.
- Added root and mobile high/critical audit scripts. Root audit found 0 vulnerabilities; mobile high/critical audit passed but has 10 moderate Expo-template transitive advisories where `npm audit fix --force` would downgrade Expo.
- Added backend-readiness artifacts: `database/migrations/0001_initial.sql`, `database/seeds/0001_reference_data.sql`, `docs/openapi.json`, and Node contract tests for OpenAPI/database coverage.
- After adding final audit/CI convenience scripts, further escalated local reruns were blocked by Codex usage limits. `npm test` still passed 8/8 in the sandbox; prior escalated `npm run test:mobile`, `npm run test:browser`, and individual high audit commands passed before the final script/doc edits.
- Added first executable API runtime scaffold in `apps/api` using Node's built-in HTTP server and test runner. The runtime is in-memory and validates health, public discovery, daily check-ins, deed completion, blessings, reports, verified donation campaigns, donation idempotency, and standard error request IDs.
- Accepted ADR 002 as the production backend direction: NestJS + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Prisma, with versioned SQL retained for database-specific constraints, indexes, retention, and audit behavior.
- Tightened the API runtime after sub-agent contract review: added a deterministic dev bearer auth guard, `/me` user/profile/subscription shape, duplicate daily check-in conflict, OpenAPI-aligned blessing/donation validation, region filtering, cursor-style slicing, and public-ID database guidance.
- Added Playwright visual regression coverage for Today, Map/Environment, and dark-mode Community prototype states across mobile and desktop Chromium. CI runs the visual job on `windows-latest` to match the committed `win32` screenshot baselines.
- Installed NestJS 11, `@nestjs/swagger`, `@prisma/client` 7, and TypeScript tooling in `apps/api`; scaffolded a typed NestJS backend target with DTO validation, dev bearer auth guard, Swagger setup, and route modules mirroring the current contract runtime. Prisma CLI 7 install is blocked locally until Node is upgraded from `20.17.0` to `20.19+`. Added API dependency audit coverage to the root security gate.
- Installed Expo Router and added route files for Today, Map, Deeds, Community, and Profile under `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)`, with the custom Foobow shell driving route-aware tab navigation.
- Added `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` as a Prisma persistence target that mirrors the SQL migration draft, public IDs, moderation tables, subscription records, and donation idempotency constraints.
- Cleaned the task board so completed framework, route, browser, and visual-regression work is no longer listed as future work; remaining next steps are credential/Node/service dependent.
- Ran a real PA audit from Chromium-rendered visual baselines after local server/browser launch was blocked by the current environment. Found P1 prototype UI issues: mobile bottom nav overlaps the Today CTA and Community headings clip on mobile/desktop. Added `docs/pa-audit-2026-06-07.md` and next tasks.
- Fixed Claude Code orchestration access by backing up `C:\Users\crane\.claude\settings.json` and removing stale custom API/proxy override keys that were taking precedence over the user's Claude.ai Pro OAuth login. A minimal `claude -p` call returned `CLAUDE_OK`. A later repo-context prompt to Claude was blocked by the approval layer because it would transmit private workspace context to an external model.
- Fixed the Expo Router/react/react-dom CI dependency conflict by explicitly pinning `react-dom@19.2.3` to match the Expo-selected `react@19.2.3`; mobile typecheck passes after the lockfile update.
- Fixed PA audit layout findings in `prototype/styles.css`: mobile bottom navigation no longer overlays the Today CTA or Community feed, Community headings have inner screen padding, Map content is not cramped by the nav, and desktop Today no longer forces a large blank lower viewport. Refreshed Playwright visual baselines after inspecting the new screenshots.
- Ran `npm run test:all` successfully after the fixes: 16 root tests, 18 API tests/typecheck, mobile typecheck, 10 browser PA tests, 6 visual regression tests, and high/critical audit gates passed. Mobile still reports known moderate Expo transitive `uuid` advisories that require an unsafe breaking force fix.
- Added sprint readiness docs for production auth strategy, map provider decision, localization workflow, mobile release checklist, and Node `20.19.4` readiness. Added `.node-version` and root content tests so these release-readiness artifacts stay linked from README and cover the required decision points.
- Verified GitHub Actions run `27107971093` passed after the sprint readiness commit. Addressed its forward-looking runner notices by upgrading checkout/setup-node to current Node 24 runtime action majors, pinning visual regression to `windows-2025`, and adding a root test for those workflow expectations.

## Working Principles

- Use ODD to keep development tied to product objects and user-visible value.
- Prefer reusable patterns from proven products before inventing custom behavior.
- Keep docs updated with each meaningful project change.
- Maintain automated checks for docs, prototype smoke behavior, and PA readiness.
- Treat virtual karma as symbolic comfort; keep verified donations transparent and separate.

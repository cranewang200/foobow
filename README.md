# Foobow

Foobow is a mobile-first concept for a virtual good karma app. Users explore the world through a map, complete small symbolic good deeds, build a gentle daily ritual, socialize through low-pressure kindness, and optionally support verified real-world causes.

The first deliverable in this repository is intentionally product-led:

- A feature/component design spec.
- User stories for the main product roles.
- Reference-product notes from map, wellness, charity, cleanup, and social-good apps.
- A clickable static prototype that shows the expected product shape.

## Prototype

Open the prototype directly in a browser:

```text
prototype/index.html
```

The prototype includes:

- Today check-in and recommended deed.
- Map-first exploration surface.
- Virtual deed catalog.
- Anonymous blessing wall.
- Profile, impact, badges, donation prompt, language toggle, and dark/light mode.

## Mobile App

The Expo/React Native MVP scaffold lives in:

```text
apps/mobile
```

Useful commands:

```text
npm --prefix apps/mobile run start
npm run test:mobile
```

The mobile shell currently ports the prototype's core flows: Today, Map, Deeds, Community, Profile, category filters, symbolic karma, safe donation copy, privacy settings, and low-pressure blessing interactions. Expo Router is installed and the tab routes live under `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)`.

## API App

The API scaffold lives in:

```text
apps/api
```

Useful commands:

```text
npm --prefix apps/api run start
npm --prefix apps/api run start:nest
npm run test:api
```

`start` runs the proven dependency-light contract runtime. `start:nest` runs the typed NestJS production scaffold selected in ADR 002.

## Product Direction

Foobow should feel calm, premium, emotionally warm, and trustworthy. It should avoid casino-style gamification or claims that users can buy luck, virtue, or karma. Virtual actions provide symbolic comfort; verified donations and sponsored campaigns are clearly labeled as real-world impact.

## Verification

Run all current checks:

```text
npm test
```

The current test suite uses only built-in Node.js modules and covers:

- Unit checks for required product components and documentation links.
- Smoke checks for prototype JavaScript syntax and static HTTP serving.
- PA checks for baseline accessibility, privacy, moderation, and donation safety wording.

Additional gates:

```text
npm run test:mobile
npm run test:api
npm run test:browser
npm run test:visual
npm run test:advisories
```

- Add local PostgreSQL service with documented schema/seed setup and verified read-path seed coverage.
- Add Prisma 7 PostgreSQL driver adapter wiring for runtime database access.
- Convert Nest account, check-in, deed action, blessing, report, and donation paths to Prisma-backed persistence with fixture fallback.
- Add local Prisma write smoke script for account creation, daily check-in, deed completion, blessing/report creation, and donation idempotency.

- Add shared catalog contract and verification gate for prototype/mobile/API/SQL seed product-object alignment.
- Add root external-service `.env.example`, local `.env.local` placeholder, resource setup checklist, and env contract verification gate.
- Reduce the mobile MVP env contract to Supabase/local Postgres, Clerk, Mapbox, API URL, and local dev token; mark Stripe as optional donation mode and remove any email-provider requirement from MVP setup.
- Add a consolidated API DB integration suite that runs Prisma write-path and Nest HTTP DB smoke checks locally and in CI, tags each run, and cleans up its own smoke records.
- Add a Dependency advisory watchlist and verification gate for accepted moderate Prisma/Expo transitive advisories.
- Add durable `AGENTS.md` rules for Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini usage rotation.
- Add sprint audit and next-plan notes based on current repo status and the public meditation reference page.
- Add Calm Ritual feature spec for optional ambient focus sessions around symbolic good deeds.
- Prototype the Calm Ritual flow in the static prototype and Expo shell: optional soundscape, focus timer, guided steps, accessible completion, quiet progress, and reduced-motion-safe copy.
- Add focus-session API/database draft: OpenAPI paths, SQL migration, Prisma models, idempotent completion, private reflections, and contract tests.
- Add provider CLI setup plan for Supabase, Clerk, Mapbox, optional Stripe, and provider-backed PA gates.
- Add `.nvmrc` so nvm-compatible shells standardize Node on `20.19.4`.

## Next

- Upgrade default local Node to `20.19.4+`; until then, continue running Prisma commands with bundled Node `24.14.0`.
- Add production authentication provider once account/session requirements and credentials are selected.
- Use CLI to create development resources after user provides provider account inputs: Supabase org/region/password, Clerk app access, Mapbox account, and optional Stripe mode if donation checkout should be tested now.
- Keep assigning planning/review tasks to Claude/Gemini while Codex is above 80%, record timeout/429 failures as orchestration blockers, and validate their outputs before integration.
- Run provider-backed PA once Clerk, Supabase/Postgres, and Mapbox values are available and wired.
- Expand the API DB integration suite toward isolated throwaway schemas or databases for parallel CI jobs.
- Monitor Expo SDK 56 and Prisma CLI 7 moderate transitive audit advisories for safe upstream fixes without force-downgrading the stack.

## Backlog

- Real map provider integration.
- Deed action persistence.
- Verified donation campaign workflow.
- Subscription and ad policy.

# Foobow API Interface

This is the product-level API shape for future implementation. It avoids framework-specific details until the backend stack is selected.

Executable OpenAPI draft: [`openapi.json`](openapi.json).

Runtime scaffold: [`../apps/api`](../apps/api) implements the first dependency-light subset of this contract for local validation. It is intentionally in-memory and does not replace the future production backend framework.

## Auth And User

Base path: `/api/v1`.

All authenticated endpoints require a bearer session token. Public discovery endpoints can be read-only, rate-limited, and must never expose private journals or hidden/moderated content.

## Common Contracts

### Pagination

Collection endpoints use cursor pagination:

```json
{
  "items": [],
  "page_info": {
    "next_cursor": "opaque-cursor-or-null",
    "has_next_page": false
  }
}
```

### Error Shape

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "details": [
      { "field": "amount", "issue": "must be greater than zero" }
    ],
    "request_id": "req_123"
  }
}
```

### Standard Error Codes

- `unauthorized`
- `forbidden`
- `not_found`
- `validation_error`
- `conflict`
- `rate_limited`
- `moderation_required`
- `unverified_campaign`
- `idempotency_conflict`
- `internal_error`

### Rate Limits

- Anonymous read endpoints: strict IP/device limits.
- Authenticated social write endpoints: per-user rate limits.

## API Rules

- Public responses must respect `privacy_mode` and quiet ranking mode.
- Journal bodies must never appear in public APIs.
- Donation endpoints must reject unverified campaigns.
- Karma points cannot be purchased through donation or subscription APIs.
- Moderation status must be checked before community content is returned.
- Donation creation must be idempotent by `Idempotency-Key`.
- Focus-session completion must be idempotent by `Idempotency-Key` and must not double-award karma on retry.
- Focus-session reflections are private journal-like data and must never appear in public feeds, rankings, or social APIs.
- Focus-session completion thresholds are evaluated server-side from elapsed duration, not trusted from a client `completed` flag.
- Webhooks from a future payment provider must verify signatures before updating payment status.
- List endpoints must use cursor pagination, not unbounded arrays.
- Public IDs should be opaque and must not reveal user count or sequence position.
- Runtime IDs map to `public_id` values for dynamic records or `slug` values for static catalog records; internal database bigint keys must not be exposed to clients.
- All write endpoints must return request IDs in error responses for support/debugging.

## Payment / Donation Webhook Flow

- Client creates donation with an idempotency key.
- Server verifies campaign is active and `verification_status = verified`.
- Server creates pending donation record and payment-provider checkout.
- Payment provider sends signed webhook.
- Server verifies signature and updates payment status.
- Receipt URL is attached only after successful payment confirmation.
- Karma progress is not increased by payment; donation impact is shown separately.
